## 🎲 Game Rules

- Dealer must hit on 16 and below, stand on 17 and above
- Blackjack (natural 21 with 2 cards) pays 3:2
- Regular wins pay 1:1
- Push (tie) returns your bet
- Aces count as 1 or 11

## ➕ Clarifications

- The project brief doesn't mention a 'blackjack win' (i.e., getting 21 with your first two cards), but it's a normal game rule, so I included it in the project. If both player and dealer gets a 'blackjack', then the game is considered a 'push', rather than a 'win' for the player
- I used email verification link as the authentication system
